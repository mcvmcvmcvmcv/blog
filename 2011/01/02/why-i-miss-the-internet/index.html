<p>In the course of regular conversations, I sometimes take positions like: &#8220;books will never die because the experience of holding and looking at a book cannot be replaced by a screen,&#8221; or, &#8220;at some point, the stimuli we encounter online will produce a movement valuing a longer attention span,&#8221; or, &#8220;it would be great if I could live without a high-speed internet connection at my house.&#8221; I can support all of these propositions, and I do sometimes fantasize about a life &#8220;free from&#8221; technology, but lately I&#8217;ve been thinking that I&#8217;ve been away from the internet for too long, and that it&#8217;s time to come back. This may sound strange, given that I&#8217;ve done a reasonable job of updating this blog over the past year and a half, but it&#8217;s not too difficult to explain why I&#8217;ve arrived at this conclusion. </p>
<p>I came to Japan almost exactly two years ago, after working a desk job which required that I spend my entire day in front of a computer with an open browser. Still, almost every day I would come home from work and sit right back down in front of the computer again. Any desk jockeys will understand the unpleasant feeling of attachment to one&#8217;s computer. At times, during my longer internet voyages, I would feel that I had simply run out of new stuff to look at, but still continue to click through pages in search of something new. It&#8217;s no coincidence that my most prolific period of blogging (<a href="http://mcvmcv.blogspot.com/2008_07_01_archive.html">19 posts in July 2008</a>) came at this time: every day, I could trawl the internet for new photographers, books, or thoughts. </p>

<p>After getting to Japan, I got a job teaching English. This is a standard job for Americans in Japan, and I&#8217;m still doing it now. I teach in a couple of different public junior high schools, which, coming from my desk job, has been a real breath of fresh air&#8212;liberation from the computer at last! I feel lucky that I&#8217;ve been able to teach my group of kids, rather than bored businessmen. It&#8217;s been great to be around my students; I&#8217;ve probably learned just as much about Japanese culture from them as they have about English from me. Also, it ought to go without saying, but 13-year-olds are hilarious people to be around. So teaching has been a good thing to do after escaping the office.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to realize, though, what it means that I haven&#8217;t had such a close, daily connection to the internet. Of course there are days when it&#8217;s painful to be in front of the computer non-stop, but there are also days (or hours, or perhaps just a few minutes) when you slip into some sort of groove, and find yourself stumbling upon three really fantastic photographers all at once, and they&#8217;re all in different parts of the world, and they couldn&#8217;t possibly be aware of each other (could they?), but you can see a connection between them, and it relates to your own preoccupations of that moment. That&#8217;s what I feel I&#8217;ve missed, I&#8217;m sure I have missed them because I&#8217;m not really &#8220;around&#8221; online all that much.  </p>

<p>So, this year I&#8217;m going to pony up and get a phone with a proper data plan. I ride a train for about an hour to work every day, and I think I can put in some time looking through more work, <a href="http://twitter.com/mcvmcv">using Twitter</a> more regularly, and just being a bit more <em>aware</em> of what&#8217;s happening online. I&#8217;ve got a few other things planned for 2011, but I&#8217;ll keep them under wraps for now. It should be a big year though, so hang around and watch me make some things happen! </p>
