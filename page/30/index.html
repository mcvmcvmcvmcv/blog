						<p>About three years ago it was very hard to look at Flickr without coming across My Little Dead Dick, a photo project between <a href="http://www.hellopatpat.com/">Patrick Tsai</a> and <a href="http://www.madiju.com/">Madi Ju</a> documenting their life together. So many things about that project seemed so right for the time: here were young people shooting film through compact cameras with abandon, taking the material of their own lives and turning it into art, all seemingly without very much effort at all. If they worked &#8220;jobs&#8221; at all, that didn&#8217;t come through in their photos&#8212;which seemed born of a will to live and breathe photography at each waking moment. Apart from the obvious/voyeuristic interest people have in observing other people&#8217;s lives, I think this seriously unrestrained drive to shoot made the project a breath of fresh air in the internet photo world. It&#8217;s hard to speak about &#8220;generations&#8221; online, because everything moves quickly, but I&#8217;m sure My Little Dead Dick will come to be cited as an important reference point for some crop of hotshot photographers coming to your monitor in a few years. Pat and Madi were, for me at least, the first and last real Flickr stars. </p>

</div>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;d read <a href="http://pingmag.jp/2008/07/04/the-death-of-my-little-dead-dick/">an interview with Pat where he said he was moving to Tokyo</a>, so once I got here I sent him an email to see if he wanted to hang out. I didn&#8217;t actually expect to hear from him, but he got right back to me and we met up a couple of days later. We&#8217;ve been really good friends since then &#8211; Pat is one of the most generous dudes I know, and I&#8217;m forever indebted to him for hooking me up with my job here. </p>

<p>Pat has a new exhibit which is opening this coming Saturday, September 4, at <a href="http://www.cltvt.org/">Cultivate Gallery</a> in Tokyo. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Hot Water,&#8221; and I don&#8217;t want to give away too much but it is definitely worth checking out. There&#8217;s an opening party on Saturday from 5-8, I&#8217;ll be there and if you mention Street Level Japan (just yell it out if you dont recognize me ok, i prob wont be the only paleface) I&#8217;ll get you a beer.</p>
<p>The exhibit is up from September 4 &#8211; September 26, <strong>only open on Saturdays and Sundays</strong> from 2-7pm. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;source=s_q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=%E3%80%92101-0031%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E5%8D%83%E4%BB%A3%E7%94%B0%E5%8C%BA%E6%9D%B1%E7%A5%9E%E7%94%B01-3-5+&#038;sll=35.905737,139.876556&#038;sspn=0.508336,0.883026&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;hq=&#038;hnear=Japan,+T%C5%8Dky%C5%8D+Metropolis+Chiyoda+Ward%E6%9D%B1%E7%A5%9E%E7%94%B0%EF%BC%91%E4%B8%81%E7%9B%AE%EF%BC%93%E2%88%92%EF%BC%95&#038;ll=35.693456,139.780437&#038;spn=0.004017,0.006899&#038;z=17"><span class="caps">GOOG</span> <span class="caps">MAP</span></a></p>

<p>これからちょっと日本語でブログを書くと思う。去年（２００９）の一月に来てから、日本語が勉強していた。あまり上手じゃなくてけど、これからもっとおそわりたい。当たり前、よくミスします。。。</p>
<p>このブログに質問したい。日本語で、面白い写真についてテキスト読みたいです。漢字はゆっくり電子字書でしらべる。オススメのあるかな？？畠山直哉の言葉が面白そうかもしれない。</p>
<p>ミスする時、いつでも声かけてください！よろしくおねがいします！</p>
<p>i want to use this blog to practice japanese. i&#8217;m not any good right now, but i&#8217;m learning more, and maybe people could talk back and forth??? anyway for your own entertainment, this is what google says i wrote. i would hope that i come across slightly better to a japanese reader:</p>
<p>I think now a little blog in Japanese. Last year (2009) came a month after, and was studying Japanese. But, not so good, Osowaritai further. Naturally, the common mistakes. . .</p>
<p>Question to this blog. In Japanese, the text to read about funny pictures. Kanji 字書 look it up in slow electron. Recommend you might be? ? Words might be interesting Naoya Hatakeyama.</p>
<p>When you make a mistake, please talk to her anytime! Thank you!</p>

<p>it&#8217;s been too long without a post, though certainly not for any lack of activity here. a couple of conversations with some people here, and seeing tavi&#8217;s blog a few times, has led me to believe that i should be a little bit more open about what i am doing here in japan. so i will give an update on that soon. </p>
<p>about two years ago i made myself write enough posts so that i could have one go up every weekday. sitting at a desk all day made that easier, and that&#8217;s not my situation now, but i think posting 2-3 times a week should be pretty reasonable. <a href="http://www.eyecurious.com/">marc</a> thought it was better to let posts be infrequent but of a higher quality. i have been in that mode of writing for the last few months, but it&#8217;s not very fulfilling for me, blog posts as a rule do not get very much reaction &#8211; this is true even of marc&#8217;s posts, which are a cut above most of the blog chatter. (hi marc, how ya doin man???) i want to actually be practicing my writing, and to start doing that i have to be posting more. </p>
<p>of course you can expect the same type of posts which continue to bring my millions of visitors back each month, still unsatiated in their desire to consume anti-cynical, pro-revolutionary critique of contemporary japanese photography&#8230;</p>

					<div class="entry">
						<p>Towards the end of 2009, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art put up two exhibits featuring Japanese photography. The main attraction, “<a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/exhibitions/398">The Provoke Era</a>,” was a straightforward survey of Japanese photography, starting from the immediate postwar period (Shomei Tomatsu, Hosoe Eikoh), moving to the more radical late 60’s (Hiromi Tsuchida, Daido Moriyama, the rest of the “Provoke” gang) and ending with a confused collection of photos from the 80’s and 90’s (cult street snapper Katsumi Watanabe sharing space with landscape photographer Toshio Shibata and art star Hiroshi Sugimoto). All of the photographs in this exhibition were black-and-white, and taken by men.</p>
<p>Having showed all the “old masters”—a few Nobuyoshi Araki prints were up there too, of course—the second exhibit, “<a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/exhibitions/399">Photography Now: China, Japan, Korea</a>“ was meant to give some young guns a chance to shine. But a curious thing happened in the Japan space. After already looking at the work of some 30 different men, all the prints by female Japanese photographers were grouped together, in one corner of the room.</p>
<p>Only so much can be read into this, but I think it may reflect a certain attitude about “female Japanese photographers”—namely, that people are interested in talking about them as “female Japanese photographers.” <a href="http://japan-photo.info/blog/2010/05/09/rink-kawauchi-lieko-shiga-exhibitions-lectures-at-photobook-festival-kassel-germany/">Ferdinand has given a talk on this topic</a>, but I can’t say if it was any good. There was <a href="http://www.nyartbeat.com/event/2010/A291">an exhibit at Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts in <span class="caps">NYC</span></a>, looking at a few conceptual female photographers like Tomoko Sawada who are “often highlighting and questioning stereotypes of traditional female roles in Japanese society.” Without having bothered to research this too deeply—I’m not a scholar yet—my guess is that “female Japanese photographers” are being used to fit some sort of Western critical narrative. (And probably not a very interesting one, at that… waiting for the Brechtian critics to emerge)</p>
<p>But, I digress. As always, I come to celebrate! In this post I want to introduce Mari Sugino, a “female Japanese photographer” who has been participating in the semi-legendary Place M seminar in Tokyo for a couple of years now. I first saw her work at an exhibit at Konica Minolta Gallery with a friend, and we were both really impressed by her ability to capture quick portraits of people on the street in Tokyo. When I talked to Sugino-san she told me that she isn’t particularly interested in “making it” in the art world. She’s shooting for herself, although of course it wouldn’t be bad to find some success. So no critical narratives today, just very nicely done photos.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve made <a href="http://blog.mcvmcv.net/articles/emi-fukuyama">a couple of posts</a> about <a href="http://fukuyamaemi.com/">Emi Fukuyama</a> before &#8211; I think she&#8217;s worth paying attention to. The photo above was part of <a href="http://tppg.jp/past/other2010/pastshinjuku.html">Totem Pole Photo Gallery&#8217;s &#8220;Shinjuku X <span class="caps">TPPG</span>&#8221; exhibit</a>, which featured work about Shinjuku from Totem Pole&#8217;s five members. It was very well done, including a free black-and-white magazine for the first 250 people to visit. From the link above you can see a few more images from the show. </p>
<p>Anyway, I was really impressed with this photo. It has all of Emi&#8217;s hallmarks &#8211; something in the foreground obscuring your view, a really muted range of tones &#8211; but this time I get an almost sinister feel from her work. It&#8217;s like looking at Tokyo in a fun-house mirror; I&#8217;ve seen a million photos of this building, and seen it in person plenty of times, but I&#8217;ve never seen it look like this before. </p>
<p>I received an email message a few days ago from a reader who said he had been really moved by Emi&#8217;s work. I may have said it before, but I am looking forward to bigger things in the future from Emi. </p>

It was started by <a href="http://www.jonikaranka.com/">Joni Karanka</a>, a photographer living in Wales who found himself frustrated that &#8220;the access to photography has become universal, but its display has become very hard.&#8221; </p>
<p>The idea of the Stravaganza is that anyone in the world can send in their prints, which are tacked up on a wall somewhere before being packed off to the next destination. <b>This means that if you hurry, you can send in a print or two and have them added to the group.</b> So far this exhibit has gone up in America, Europe and Asia (7 places so far), and after Tokyo we&#8217;re hoping to bring it to the 2010 Higashikawa Photo Festival. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in Tokyo, the exhibit is up from July 3 to 16, and there will be a number of parties at the gallery. As you might imagine, the stresses of writing an internationally recognized blog about photography are many, and to unwind I sometimes play records as &#8220;DJ I Am Baseball&#8221;&#8212;I want to register <a href="http://www.iamdjiambaseball.dj/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iamdjiambaseball.dj</a> but it looks like domains in Djibouti run on the expensive side. Anyway I will be playing our <b>opening party on July 3, from 7:00pm</b>. I guarantee a good time, plus mention Street Level Japan for my infinite good will in honoring your song request! It&#8217;s a 500 yen to get in, which gets you either a beer or a zine we&#8217;re making. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <span class="caps">BBQ</span> on July 11, check <a href="http://dkpsjapan.blogspot.com/">our blog (in Japanese)</a> or just email me for more information. I&#8217;ll be hanging out on basically all weekend days it&#8217;s up. </p>
<p>The space, <a href="http://www.galleryseptima.com/">Gallery Septima</a>, is located near Tachikawa, but it only takes about 40 minutes to reach from Shinjuku. If you want to send prints, you can find the gallery&#8217;s address right on their site. </p>

<li>From May 14 &#8211; May 21, <a href="http://www.zen-foto.jp/web/html/about.html">Zen Foto Gallery</a> will be showing a collaboration between Nobuyoshi Araki and young Chinese photographer Wu Chin-Chin. When I saw Zen Foto proprietor Mark last week, he was extraordinarily mum about the show, almost as a ruse to pique my interest. Maybe this press release will explain further: &#8220;the content is not suitable for people under the age of 20 or for those sensitive to explicit images of the naked human body.&#8221; <b>Note:</b> you must make a reservation to see the show, by <a href="mailto:amanda@zen-foto.jp">emailing the gallery directly</a>. Also, there is an entrance fee, which can be applied to Zen Foto publications. (I recommend the <a href="http://blog.mcvmcv.net/2010/03/10/liu-ke-still-lake-at-zen-foto-gallery">Liu Ke</a> book.) </li>
<li>From May 11 &#8211; May 23, Street Level Japan favorite <a href="http://fukuyamaemi.com/">Emi Fukuyama</a> will hold her latest show at Street Level Japan favorite <a href="http://tppg.jp/">Totem Pole Photo Gallery</a>. The preview image up on Totem Pole&#8217;s site looks great, I&#8217;m highly recommending a trip to this show.</li>
<li>From now until May 29, Kenji Hosoe (son of Eikoh) is holding an exhibit at <a href="http://tosei-sha.jp/english/index.html">Tosei-Sha</a>. I have to admit I didn&#8217;t know what to expect from the show, but Hosoe <i>fils</i> has a sharp eye for composition. I wonder where he got it from. This show is worth a look.</li>
<li>From now until June 19, the <a href="http://www.tokyoartbeat.com/event/2010/89E5.en">Instituto Cervantes de Tokio</a> will be showing a series of photographs taken by Jorge Luis Borges along with some of his writings. Frankly I can&#8217;t believe that this is real; <a href="http://mcvmcv.net/mcvmcv.html">Borges is the inspiration for the domain name mcvmcv.net</a>, on which this blog is hosted. I am really looking forward to seeing this exhibit, which apparently has 130 photographs taken by Borges (although I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it was just stuff he found and threw together, and that would still be cool). <i>&#8220;Un libro, cualquier libro, es para nosotros un objeto sagrado&#8230;&#8221;</i>

<p>One more thought related to <a href="http://blog.mcvmcv.net/2010/05/06/koji-takiguchi-and-material-tension">Koji Takiguchi</a>:</p>
<p>Some Japanese photographers will make it really clear in their work that they&#8217;ve gone through a lot of <i>trouble</i> to make their photographs. In other words, it can be painfully clear that the photographer had to climb a mountain, or wait three hours somewhere in the freezing cold, to get their shot. (Maybe this tendency is equally present in non-Japanese photographers as well.) Anyway, this work can just as easily fail to stimulate the imagination as photos taken by someone who rolls out of bed every morning and shoots a roll on their way to the corner store. The pointless &#8220;<a href="http://www.artunlimited.co.jp/nakano/bio_e.html#">Tokyo Nobody</a>&#8220; series comes to mind as an example of a series that was both extremely difficult to produce, and extremely boring to look at. &#8220;<span class="caps">PEEP</span>&#8221; obviously required a lot of effort&#8212;finding appropriate subjects, carting a large format camera to their three locations, getting them comfortable with this invasion&#8212;but the photographs overshadow this physical labor.</p>

<p><a href="http://kojitaki.com/">Koji Takiguchi</a> is a young photographer from Yokohama who looks to be on the verge of breaking out. He won a <a href="http://www.canon.com/scsa/newcosmos/index.html">Canon New Cosmos Prize</a> in 2004, winning praise from Nobuyoshi Araki. In 2008, he published &#8220;<a href="http://kojitaki.com/project/sou/">Sou</a>,&#8221; an unflinching, often difficult look at a number of events in his family life: the death of his wife&#8217;s parents and their cat, followed by the birth of his own child. Two years on from that project, Takiguchi is in the middle of a new series, &#8220;<a href="http://kojitaki.com/project/peep/"><span class="caps">PEEP</span></a>.&#8221; This work should earn him a new level of appreciation within Japan, and hopefully outside of it as well. &#8220;Sou&#8221; is remarkable for its direct approach to Takiguchi&#8217;s own pain and joy, but with &#8220;<span class="caps">PEEP</span>&#8221; he has distinguished himself from many of his contemporaries by making a similarly direct inquiry into questions of class, happiness, family, work and vice in current Japanese culture. </p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="caps">PEEP</span>&#8221; is a series of portraits of Japanese people, where each person is photographed three times: in their home, at work, and at play. This approach seems well suited to Japan, where one&#8217;s private life is often kept hidden from view.* Photographing a person wearing these three different masks, so to speak, might seem like a good way to &#8220;reveal&#8221; who they are. And indeed, in his statement for the series, Takiguchi claims that the concept of &#8220;<span class="caps">PEEP</span>&#8221; is to avoid a &#8220;one-sided only&#8221; approach, and allow the subjects to &#8220;have self-direction and stare back&#8221; at us. </p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;He edits an economy magazine. He has lots of hobbies, including reading books of course, but he is also interested in collecting music (records, etc.) and various subcultures.  Besides cultural activities, he also likes table tennis and it seems he sometimes exercises in order to alleviate stress.  I think he is fully enjoying a life on his own.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, despite its title, &#8220;<span class="caps">PEEP</span>&#8221; is not meant to be an exercise in voyeurism. Takiguchi is very deliberate about the way he photographs his subjects, to the point of making his own disruption into their lives clear. After all, he is something of an intruder: he has to follow them into their home and workplace, then set up a large format camera and snap away! After going through such trouble, how would it be possible to let someone have &#8220;self-direction&#8221; while trying to shoot a candid photo?** So the subject always looks directly into the camera; they can control the way that they represent themselves, which allows the viewer a chance to meet their gaze comfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been working at a dating website for a long time. He&#8217;s dreaming of musical activities in an indie band. It seems like a lot of the people who are active musically are employed at places like dating websites.  Work is work, and he&#8217;s doing that work in order to do things he wants to do and make a living.</p>
<p>The friends in his area know what his job is, but they don&#8217;t seem to know what he does in a concrete sense.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that sense (i.e. as a concept), &#8220;<span class="caps">PEEP</span>&#8221; functions properly, but there&#8217;s more to the series than Takiguchi is letting on. This work documents certain material realities of contemporary Japan, without using a photographic vocabulary of &#8220;this is good&#8221; or &#8220;this is bad&#8221;&#8212;as if we could say those words with a straight face <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ur0qo_B1QzwC&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=genealogy+of+morals&#038;ei=jn3iS8nnD5WKkATJ-_i8CQ&#038;cd=1#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false">anyway</a>! The power of this series comes from the tension that exists between the roles one must play in society; namely between one&#8217;s work and everything else, because at any time, work can demand sacrifices against one&#8217;s will. Group activities can create similar demands, with almost as much power behind them, not to mention one&#8217;s obligation to family.*** In the face of this condition, how do people enjoy themselves? What relation is there between class and happiness? Is there any connection between work and play? What does having a &#8220;good&#8221; job do to someone&#8217;s life? Is it possible to balance work and family? &#8220;<span class="caps">PEEP</span>&#8221; brings out these kinds of questions, which is remarkable for a work of Japanese photography. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Certain &#8220;types&#8221; of people appear that might be familiar to a Japanese audience appear in these photos, but they often show these roles in a complex light. Take the magazine editor, a neat-looking young professional by day, who turns out to be a record-playing, whiskey-sipping Lothario by night. Having seen this come-hither pose, his little smirk in front of the mountains of paper which have built up at his desk takes on a different meaning. The artist&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko">pachinko</a> habit is surprising in that pachinko is associated with old men, or the lower class in general. She can also afford a devious smile, but that&#8217;s not true of the <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/108007/What-is-the-best-online-dating-site-for-Japan#1557217">deai site</a> worker, who looks unable to hide his glumness in all three of his portraits. Some people are able to make work less painful&#8212;a <a href="http://kojitaki.com/project/peep/work13.html">surfboard maker</a> seems to have struck the best balance&#8212;but others seem unable to deal with this tension.</p>
<p>Takiguchi is working in a documentary tradition going back to August Sander, whose portraits still provoke questions about the lives of the people he photographed. Only a historian would look at this work and wonder about Sander&#8217;s <i>own</i> life! Because Takiguchi takes a similarly uninterested stance with respect to <i>himself</i>, his work reflects back the lives of his subjects with maybe even more power than he intended&#8212;the work well surpasses his concept. (&#8230;and how&#8217;s that for a change?) Takiguchi has shot around 40 people so far, and he&#8217;s hoping to have 100 people completed by next year, at which point he&#8217;ll end the project. When it&#8217;s over, &#8220;<span class="caps">PEEP</span>&#8221; could very well come to be viewed as a seminal work of Japanese photography for the early millennium. </p>

<p>*Yeah, I do think this is something particularly true of Japan. If you walk down the street and see that someone is dressed a certain way, you might be able to draw one conclusion about them (they like visual-kei, they&#8217;re a construction worker, they work in an office, they&#8217;re a host, they&#8217;re a student) but not much more than that. Many people wear uniforms in Japan, and not just school or company-issued ones; fashion functions in a similar way. Clothes can function like a mask, which makes it easier to preserve one&#8217;s private life&#8212;which is why it&#8217;s so interesting to see two other sides of someone in &#8220;<span class="caps">PEEP</span>.&#8221;</p>
