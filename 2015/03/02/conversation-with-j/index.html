				<div class="entry">
					<p>Talked with J yesterday. J is a photographer I respect, and I want to record some notes about this conversation here.</p>
<p>J was speaking with an art history professor. The professor said she was planning to have her students speak about one photo each week, three hours at a time. J said that doesn&#8217;t make any sense, that there is no point in talking about a photograph for more than 10 minutes, that it&#8217;s not truthful, or that that discourse is something else, a kind of empty pontification—that&#8217;s not his word, but something like that. He says he saw another professor give a talk a couple of years ago, where he thought 90% of what was said was irrelevant.  For him, taking a photograph isn&#8217;t a deeply considered experience, it&#8217;s done quickly (for one reason or another). And so because there&#8217;s not much time involved, it&#8217;s pointless to spend all that time talking about a single photograph. Lee Friedlander, for example, he doesn&#8217;t line things up carefully, he&#8217;s just snapping away. When looking at another photographer&#8217;s work, there&#8217;s no value in looking at a single image—everything should be seen in aggregate, as part of the photographer&#8217;s larger project.</p>
<p>Compelling arguments can be mobilized against this view, and some were indeed put to J, unmoved as he was. I am recording this conversation here because I know that I will read this post later, and perhaps at that time I will be glad I was reminded about this.</p>
