</div>
<p>This facility, a former mill, was converted into an art space in 2006. The factory itself was constructed in the late 1800s, and it&#8217;s been renovated in subtle ways, largely through the introduction of gravity-powered water features that re-imagine the building in modernist terms. I arrived in the morning, and enjoyed a walk through the facility. My footsteps were not particularly loud, but they were enough to awaken a police officer who was dozing off at the entrance to the grounds.</p>
<div id="attachment_3052" style="width: 535px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3052" class="size-large wp-image-3052" src="http://blog.mcvmcv.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_8794-e1515888143622-525x700.jpg" alt="We talked here" width="525" height="700" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_8794-e1515888143622-525x700.jpg 525w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_8794-e1515888143622-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_8794-e1515888143622-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><p id="caption-attachment-3052" class="wp-caption-text">We talked here</p>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why a police officer, though? In fact, there are no musuem workers as such here, but rather a few police scattered throughout the building, a jarring phenomenon to say the very least. I asked one of them if there was a map of the facility, and we ended up having a long conversation about the art center, his work, the disappearing flora of the hillside behind the center, Oaxacan cooking traditions, and so on. P (not his actual initial) said that he&#8217;d been working there for about a year and a half; some of his colleagues have been at the center for ten years. He&#8217;d like to stay, he says, because it&#8217;s very tranquil, and he gets to interact with a lot of different people. P knew practically nothing about art before he came, and now he feels more comfortable with it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As I reflected on this experience, I thought back to a moment during a march in Los Angeles after the 2016 election in which I saw people high-fiving the police officers that were lining the road. This gesture struck me as somewhat foolish, since the cops were only here to &#8220;restore order&#8221;—that is to say beat everyone up—if things got out of hand. The situation at San Agustín strikes me as different, though. Even though the presence of police officers (<i>policia auxiliar</i>, to be fair, I guess) in this space put me on my guard, P was thoughtful, gentle, curious to share knowledge, and open to silence. Make All Cops Work in Museums? Or is that giving far too much credit to art? </span></p>
