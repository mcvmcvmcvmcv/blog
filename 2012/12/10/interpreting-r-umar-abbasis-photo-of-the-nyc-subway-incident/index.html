				<div class="entry">
					<p>Photography came to the fore of the coverage of the NYC subway pushing incident, after the New York Post ran a controversial front page image showing the victim&#8217;s last moments. The photograph has incurred the wrath of outraged internet commenters, who interpret its capture as a cynical act. This comment sums up the mood: &#8220;<a href="http://socialmediaseo.net/2012/12/05/new-york-times-nyc-subway-push-picture-grows-controversy/">Heroes help, chumps take pictures</a>.&#8221; <sup><a class="simple-footnote" title="" id="return-note-1200-1" href="#note-1200-1">1</a></sup> The photographer, freelancer R. Umar Abbasi, has claimed that he was using his flash to warn the train conductor that a person had fallen onto the tracks.</p>
<p>While this is clearly not the place to judge the practical value of Abbasi&#8217;s actions, I&#8217;m interested in this event as it relates to photography. In <a href="http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2012/12/07/subway-photographer-its-chilling-to-me/">an interview with Anderson Cooper</a> <sup><a class="simple-footnote" title="" id="return-note-1200-2" href="#note-1200-2">2</a></sup>, Abbasi says that he was not looking at the viewfinder at all; the camera was extended from his body, so he was (in his own words) &#8220;shooting from the hip.&#8221; If we take this explanation at face value, he was operating the camera in the crudest manner possible, not even as a &#8220;dumb&#8221; button pusher but without any intent at all to produce images—these were just side effects of the flash. As he explains in the video, his camera was still on a daylight setting, from a previous shoot before he went underground.</p>
<p>The fact does remain that one of these underexposed, apparently unintended images still made the cover of a major metropolitan newspaper (I&#8217;m not sure how else to describe the Post in a way that makes it seem respectable). However, taken by itself, the quality of this image cannot cast any doubt upon the photographer&#8217;s claim. The reason for this should be obvious: it&#8217;s possible to produce a technically crisp image with literally no effort at all. Reading the coverage of this incident has reminded me of something Thomas Demand said when I interviewed him earlier this year: &#8220;Technically, photography is actually not that difficult. Now, it becomes clearer and clearer as everybody has a camera that it is pretty simple. A digital camera makes amazing photographs without you doing anything. The standard setting of a Canon Mark 3 just blows your mind, it’s fantastic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether you want to call it &#8220;technically crisp,&#8221; &#8220;amazing&#8221; or &#8220;beautiful,&#8221; it&#8217;s all the same thing: the aesthetic quality of images. We&#8217;re only a short jump away here from the old discussion (everyone&#8217;s favorite, I know!) of the <a title="“The sea of images”" href="http://blog.mcvmcv.net/2012/09/06/the-sea-of-images/">&#8220;sea of images&#8221;</a> <sup><a class="simple-footnote" title="" id="return-note-1200-3" href="#note-1200-3">3</a></sup> and why <a href="http://blog.mcvmcv.net/2012/09/08/water-again/">beauty is useless as a goal</a> <sup><a class="simple-footnote" title="" id="return-note-1200-4" href="#note-1200-4">4</a></sup>, and we can leave it aside for now. What jumps out from Demand&#8217;s quote is the idea that the relative technical ease of photography is <em>not</em> directly tied to the &#8220;rise&#8221; of digital photography. Digital, instead, is making it easier to perceive this state of affairs, though perhaps it&#8217;s taking longer to sink in than Abbasi might have liked.</p>
