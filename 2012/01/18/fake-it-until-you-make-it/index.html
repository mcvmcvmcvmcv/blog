<p>A few weeks ago I wrote a post <a href="http://blog.mcvmcv.net/2011/12/26/after-death-picking-up-the-pieces-of-photography-criticism">responding to A.D. Coleman&#8217;s talk</a> &#8220;Dinosaur Bones.&#8221; At the time, I sent it over to Coleman to see what he would think of it; I figured that he probably wasn&#8217;t going to get too many responses that engaged him, and that he might like to read what I wrote. As it turns out, he enjoyed the post, and proposed that we continue to talk about the issues brought up in &#8220;Dinosaur Bones&#8221; through a kind of loose online correspondence. I agreed, and Coleman&#8217;s first article <a href="http://nearbycafe.com/artandphoto/photocritic/?p=10503">&#8220;Letters to a Young Critic (1)&#8221;</a> went up online a couple of days ago. </p>
<p>I do have a small reservation about being cast as the &#8220;young critic.&#8221; I don&#8217;t want to be treated merely as a foil for A.D. Coleman&#8217;s eminent brilliance, though I do trust that Coleman is not approaching the dialogue in that way. (The subject line of my original email to Coleman did include the words &#8220;young critic,&#8221; so I probably brought it upon myself!) A quick look back at the history of &#8220;young&#8221; correspondents does not bode particularly well: as of today, there is no Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kappus">Franz Kappus</a>, Rilke&#8217;s &#8220;Young Poet.&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Beaufret">Jean Beaufret</a>, the addressee of Heidegger&#8217;s &#8220;Letter on Humanism,&#8221; has a pretty nice one though. Perhaps the greatest danger is that by &#8220;young&#8221; you will read &#8220;immature,&#8221; which has its own Kantian implications that are really not important to discuss here. You understand what I am saying. </p>
<p>Coleman has started out the exchange by talking concretely about the way that critics make a living. He&#8217;s shared some figures of the income he&#8217;s made over his career: roughly $20,000 in 1995 and roughly $7,000 in 2011. (I&#8217;m assuming that there is a more or less even decline between those years.) He also calculates the amount of money he&#8217;s made from the donation box on his blog, divides it by the number of posts, and comes up with a figure of $7 per post. Ouch! Of course, this is not a helpful way to examine blogging, because the form is not just limited to what Coleman says he posts online, namely &#8220;lengthy, deliberated essays, written to the same standards as the work Iâ€™ve published in print.&#8221; Blog posts can be written in 10 minutes or less, and it&#8217;s often those posts that get the most attention&#8212;for better or worse. </p>
<p>What&#8217;s the value of a blog post? I wouldn&#8217;t look at it strictly in terms of money. A friend of mine in San Francisco had a video Tumblr whose tagline read: &#8220;New media existentialism. Fake it until you make it.&#8221; She&#8217;s now the online video editor at The Atlantic. Is each post she made on that blog worth a fraction of her new salary? Probably not, but that activity has value as a whole, in the same way that this blog is the resume that got me a job at <a href="http://www.americanphotomag.com/">American Photo</a>.</p>
<p>This may appear to have an only tangential relation to the problem of making a living as a photo critic, though I think it helps set the stage of online media, where bloggers can be called up directly to the big leagues without any seasoning. Still, as <a href="http://danielcampbellblight.com/">Daniel Campbell Blight</a> noted in the comments of the last post, this discussion is &#8220;too general.&#8221; That&#8217;s probably true! There are a lot of concepts being tossed around here&#8212;photo criticism, photo theory, bloggers, online writing, offline writing&#8212;but I&#8217;m happy to sift through the mess and see what comes out of it. </p>
