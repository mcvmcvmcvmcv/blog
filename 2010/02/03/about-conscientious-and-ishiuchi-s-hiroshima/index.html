<p>Conscientious wrote <a href="http://jmcolberg.com/weblog/2009/12/review_hiroshima_by_miyako_ishiuchi.html">an internet blog post about Ishiuchi Miyako&#8217;s <em>Hiroshima</em></a> and had the chutzpah to call it a &#8220;review.&#8221; Let&#8217;s think about whether this is deserved. Here&#8217;s the first sentence of the post: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The 20th Century was filled to the brim with atrocities, war, and genocide.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>O rly? It would make just as much sense to write a sentence beginning with &#8220;Since time immemorial,&#8221; or &#8220;Throughout history.&#8221; Either way, this is a cliche. First sentence of second paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Photographers have a long tradition of trying to deal with suffering, to try to convey what it might have meant for those who perished.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, this doesn&#8217;t really mean anything, and it could be equally true of painting or sculpture or literature. We still haven&#8217;t heard about the work at all, but that&#8217;s coming in the next paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Miyako Ishiuchi&#8217;s <em>Hiroshima</em>, which I first heard about through Marc and which I just found in a Japanese book shop, is another example. <em>Hiroshima</em> shows clothing and personal items worn by victims of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima. There are about 19,000 such items in the collection of the city&#8217;s Peace Memorial Museum, and the book presents a tiny fraction of these. At the very end of the book, there is a list of the presented items, along with the names of the victims (where they are known).&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>So now we know what&#8217;s in the book. And the photos themselves, pray tell? Maybe the next and final paragraph will tell us:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is left to the viewer to deal with the images, there is no further text (apart from a short statement by the photographer), no explanations, no descriptions. Where words must fail, can images tell us something? I think they can, once we realize that what they might tell us is what we are able to tell ourselves.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh. Actually, as you now understand, it&#8217;s left for someone other than the writer to &#8220;deal&#8221; with the images. </p>
<p>So, where&#8217;s the <em>beef</em> here? Why is there no engagement with the work? What makes these muddled thoughts a &#8220;review&#8221;? At some minimal level, shouldn&#8217;t a review communicate the writer&#8217;s impressions of the thing they are claiming to tell us about? &#8220;Once we realize that what they might tell us is what we are able to tell ourselves&#8221;&#8212;what does this even mean? Can anyone parse that sentence? (In all fairness it could just contain a typo) </p>
<p>Beyond this one review, why do so many people continually reaffirm the authority of this writing? Online, any blogger can say &#8220;this is a review&#8221; (&#8221;<a href="http://www.eyecurious.com/word-of-the-year-2009/">I am a curator</a>&#8220;), and the responsibility of deciding whether to take this statement at face value falls on the audience. How will <em>this</em> audience lose its sheep-like qualities, when acting in bad faith&#8212;saying nothing means saying &#8220;yes&#8221;&#8212;is so much easier?  </p>
<p>This post was a missed opportunity, because it&#8217;s worth saying something (anything!) about Ishiuchi&#8217;s photographs. She manages the difficult task of conveying the scale of the atomic bomb&#8217;s effect without beating the viewer over the head. The entire book is <a href="http://www.ajapanesebook.com/2009/12/ishiuchi-miyako-hiroshima-2008.html">photographs of clothing and mundane objects recovered from Hiroshima (yo this is a link to a site where you can see a number of these images)</a>, and I have to admit that when it was described to me verbally I imagined that the work might have been cold, if not even boring. But this isn&#8217;t the case at all. </p>
<p>Ishiuchi&#8217;s presentation of these objects makes a quiet but clear statement about the magnitude of the atomic bomb. Each thing is recognizable, but has some visible sign of destruction. Ishiuchi photographed these objects against a plain background, and by removing any kind of identifying context, the viewer has to imagine how their particular kind of damage came about. In some cases, it&#8217;s possible to make out obvious burn marks, but others are less clear: the fabric of one garment has an eerie lightness to it which certainly did not come from overuse. A schoolgirl&#8217;s uniform with alien-looking holes ripped clear through it doesn&#8217;t need an explanation. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy viewing, but <em>Hiroshima</em> is a carefully considered portrait of August 6 which is well worth <a href="http://www.japanexposures.com/books/product_info.php?products_id=10250">seeking out</a>.</p>
<p>NB: Marc Feustel&#8217;s post about <a href="http://www.eyecurious.com/hiroshima-6-august-1945/">photographic responses to Hiroshima</a> is a good read for more on this subject. Also, August 6 falls around Japan&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_Festival"><em>obon</em> week</a>, a festival to remember the dead. I rarely have extended conversations about World War II here in Japan, but I was struck by how often the topic came up during that time, and I saw <em>Hiroshima</em> in that context. </p>
