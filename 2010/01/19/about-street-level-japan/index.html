<p>I would characterize a lot of my blogging from last year as a report of getting my bearings in Tokyo; hence the posts about stores, galleries and other things &#8220;<a href="http://blog.mcvmcv.net/articles/live-on-the-ground-in-tokyo">on the ground</a>.&#8221; At this point, I&#8217;m more interested in writing about the work that&#8217;s being produced here, and the culture supporting it. Above all, I want to think about the dialog between Japanese photography and foreign (especially Western) countries, and to add something productive to this conversation. </p>
<p>Anyone who visits Japan in general, and Tokyo in particular, will be struck by the level of photographic activity here: it bears repeating that the sheer <em>number</em> of photo magazines, camera stores, photography-focused galleries and bookstores, not to mention photographers, is impressive on its own. Yet for all of this activity&#8212;happening at &#8220;street level,&#8221; let&#8217;s say&#8212;very little of it is transmitted* abroad.</p>
<p>When I went back to San Francisco around New Year&#8217;s, I spoke to someone who works with Japanese photography in a professional capacity. This person said that they got most of their information about photography in Japan by hearing about or seeing exhibits in America. This seems obviously problematic: reaching an American gallery requires a level of backing available only to a few photographers. It shouldn&#8217;t be that hard for Japanese photographers to reach an American (or British or&#8230;) audience, especially when so much compelling work is being produced here. </p>
<p>This blog is not a crusade on behalf of Japanese photography as if it were a greatly neglected photographic tradition. Foreign audiences are already quite familiar with at least a few Japanese photographers&#8212;<a href="http://blog.mcvmcv.net/2009/10/23/about-the-moriyama-backlash">usually men born before 1940</a>. These names (Moriyama, Araki, Tomatsu, Hosoe, Kimura, etc) shouldn&#8217;t be ignored, but I would like to move forward positively from this base. Let&#8217;s keep our eyes open. </p>
<p>*I have no special knowledge of Japanese culture, and no interest in speaking about the &#8220;Japanese-ness&#8221; of anything. The farther I can distance myself from any kind of cultural &#8220;translation&#8221; the better. Whatever I write here is going to be distorted by my own experience in Japan, but I want to focus on presenting things as clearly as possible&#8212;&#8220;transmit&#8221; instead of &#8220;interpret.&#8221; For armchair cultural analysis you can read pretty much any other blog about Japan! <em>(edit: <a href="http://www.hellodamage.com/top">tokyo damage report</a> and <a href="http://www.mutantfrog.com/">mutantfrog travelogue</a> are exceptionally good though)</em></p>
