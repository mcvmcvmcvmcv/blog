<p>Brilliant installation, which destroys any illusion that you are &#8220;inside&#8221; a photograph, or looking &#8220;through&#8221; it, as a window. &#8220;Rasen Kaigan&#8221; does not have a starting point, but when you walk into the space, you are immediately aware that you are looking at three-dimensional objects.</p>
<p>Shiga made some excellent land art along the way here. This could have stood on its own as a separate work.</p>
<p>Complicated thoughts, text, layout.</p>
<p>#8s &#8211; Rock photos.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t see any images when you walk in; you are greeted by the backs of the photos.</p>
<p>Gaze of #1 bounces off #2, then is reflected (scattered?) in sea of #8s.</p>
<p>Hard/impossible to look *directly* at #1 because it is physically blocked by #2.</p>
<p>#9s &#8211; &#8220;monsters&#8221; &#8211; pitch black &#8220;photos&#8221; which actually function like mirrors. Andrew is disappointed in the printing quality, says they&#8217;re not really black.</p>
<p>#6 seems like they represent photos taken before 3/11. Not always easy to tell what&#8217;s before or after though. This is to its credit.</p>
<p>*Really* ambitious text.</p>
<p>&lt;coffee break out on the street&gt;</p>
<p>Strange effect where foreground looks like it&#8217;s shot from above, but background is straight on.</p>
<p>Why a spiral? Beach photo, etc.</p>
<p>Husband leading wife through purple pond.</p>
<p>&lt;notes added later&gt;</p>
<p>Nothing particularly &#8220;Japanese&#8221; about these photographs&#8211;not even any representation of Japanese characters, and no writing at all.</p>
<p>When you enter the exhibit, you are greeted by the backs of photographs. From the start, you are aware that you are looking at three dimensional objects, not magical &#8220;windows.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this show, it&#8217;s difficult to look at photos hung on the wall in the &#8220;normal&#8221; way.</p>
<p>What will the book look like?</p>
<p>The show is not perfect: the &#8220;map&#8221; and accompanying texts are sometimes better left ignored—perhaps, especially, at first. Shiga&#8217;s ideas are convoluted, or labyrinthine, which is after all fitting given the title of the show. The spiral is the central motif of the installation, and the images themselves.</p>
<p>Andrew notes that Shiga was not satisfied with Canary; she pushed herself when she could have made 10 more books in that vein and solidified a place for herself. What drove her to push on?</p>
<p>She has taken on the role of an organizer. She is working directly with her subjects, and they all know what she is doing—no stealth here, no snapshots. But it&#8217;s not performance-based, either. Remember Nietzsche: artist makes art out of life. Her work has an organizing function in that she is bringing people together. Author as producer, Tretiakov etc.</p>
<p>She could have made a series just of her land art photographs and called that a series. The same goes for some of the other threads running through this work.</p>
<p>Very rare to feel that one is experiencing a work of genius, which demands hours (if not days) of attention.</p>
<p>In musical terms, prog-photo, a triple album of photography, flawed but brilliant.</p>
<p>&lt;notes I&#8217;m adding now&gt;</p>
<p>This show is not perfect, but that&#8217;s not really a productive way to evaluate it. By aiming this high, Shiga has raised the bar for what a photography exhibit can be. I have continued to use the prog-rock image in describing this exhibit to other people, as a way to illustrate not just the ambition but intensity of her project.</p>
