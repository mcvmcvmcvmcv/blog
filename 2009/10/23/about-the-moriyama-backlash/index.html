					<p>I think it has become cool in a “controversial” sort of way to proclaim a strong distaste for Moriyama—like, he doesn’t <em>represent</em> Japanese photography, man! My feeling about Moriyama and Araki—who elicits the same reaction—is that at this point, they’re not worth making a fuss over. They are an unmovable part of the landscape, and regardless of whether they produce good work or bad work from here on out, their positions are secure.</p>
<p>I’m going to suggest that everyone adopt this “wild” opinion as quickly as possible! Let’s all talk about how much we hate Moriyama—not so much his photographs of course as <em>what he stands for!</em>—so that we can get through this, have a backlash against the backlash and not have to talk about it anymore.</p>
<p>This conversation frustrates me because it has little to do with photography. The view that Moriyama does not “represent” Japanese photography, or that he has stolen attention from other Japanese photographers, has more to do with the impressions that these photographs have made on foreigners. As it happens, I think a lot of Moriyama’s recent stuff isn’t very strong, and that he’s leaving himself open to fair criticism by overextending his brand, but a quick look at almost any of the recent <a href="http://blog.mcvmcv.net/2009/04/25/knock-knock-who-s-there-moriyama-daido-knock-knock-who-s-there-moriyama-daido-knock-knock-who-s-there-moriyama-daido">Record magazines</a> shows he hasn’t lost it—as if he still had to prove or justify himself anyway! A friend pointed out that his fame has only come recently; during the 70s he was literally selling whole boxes of prints to get by.</p>
<p>All that said, I agree with the feeling behind this complaint. It can’t be a good thing that Araki and Moriyama are so often equated with “Japanese photography.” But if we really wanted to see some new faces get recognition abroad, why not talk about… some new Japanese photographers?</p>
<p>Yo, did you know that Yamashita Tsuneo put a whole bunch of his “Another Time on the Ryuku Islands” photos online? He most definitely did, <a href="http://www5d.biglobe.ne.jp/~yamafoto/hitotsu01.html">go check them out</a>!</p>
